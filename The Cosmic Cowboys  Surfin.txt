# The Night We Became Cowboys (Cosmic Detour Extended Edition)


The tabs kicked in somewhere between the thrift store and the honky-tonk, right as Matthew was trying on a ten-gallon hat that looked like it had survived the actual Wild West. Yes, we were both named Matthew. This would become cosmically relevant later. The fluorescent lights started breathing, and suddenly his idea didn't seem ridiculous anymore—it seemed essential.


"We're method actors now," he declared, adjusting his bolo tie with the seriousness of a man accepting a Nobel Prize. The tie seemed to shimmer with purpose. "Tonight, we are cowboys."


I nodded sagely, my pupils the size of dinner plates. "Partner, I've never felt more yeehaw in my entire life."


The walk to the Broken Spoke became a vision quest. Every streetlight was a campfire, every passing car a thundering herd of buffalo. By the time we reached the door, we weren't just wearing cowboy costumes—we had become vessels for the eternal spirit of the American frontier, or at least that's what the acid was whispering.


The Broken Spoke was already thumping with fiddle music when we swaggered through the doors, spurs jangling (where did we even GET spurs?). The acid had us walking like we'd been riding horses for days, which apparently was exactly the right amount of bowlegged confidence for line dancing night.


"Evenin', ma'am," Matthew tipped his hat to a group of women in matching "Bride Tribe" shirts. His drawl was somewhere between Texas and a bad Matthew McConaughey impression, but the acid made it feel authentic as leather. The fact that he was also named Matthew made this deeply meta.


What happened next was a blur of boot-scooting that would've made our ancestors proud—if our ancestors had been cowboys, which they definitely weren't. We two-stepped, we cotton-eyed-joe'd, we did moves that probably weren't real but felt divinely choreographed by the honky-tonk gods themselves. The dance floor became a living thing beneath our boots, pulsing with the heartbeat of a thousand cattle drives.


The problem started when we got too good.


"Y'all must be professionals!" A woman in rhinestone boots grabbed my arm during the Electric Slide. Her rhinestones were leaving tracer patterns in the air. "Where's your ranch?"


"Oh, uh..." The acid made lying impossible. My brain was a disco ball of truth. "The ranch is... in my mind?"


The Other Matthew was cornered by the Bride Tribe, who were convinced he was a rodeo champion. He was deep into a story about breaking wild mustangs when I saw the panic in his eyes—the universal look of someone realizing they're in too deep while also being too high to navigate out. His hat seemed to be growing larger with each lie.


"BATHROOM MEETING!" I shouted, grabbing him. "COWBOY EMERGENCY!"


Somewhere in the background, "Once in a Lifetime" by Talking Heads started playing, because of course it did. David Byrne's voice asking "How did I get here?" felt personally directed at us.


We stumbled into the men's room, and the door swung shut, muffling the fiddle music into a distant pulse. The fluorescent light above the mirror didn't just flicker; it began to hum a low, resonant frequency that vibrated in our teeth. The porcelain of the sinks started to ripple, like heat haze on a long highway. The bathroom tiles were definitely breathing.


Matthew stared at our reflections, but our faces were starting to melt and run together like candle wax. Two Matthews becoming one Matthew becoming infinite Matthews. "Dude," he whispered, his voice trembling, "the mirror... it's getting... loud."


He was right. The mirror wasn't reflecting anymore; it was projecting. The silver surface swirled into a vortex of deep purple and shimmering gold, a silent, cosmic whirlpool. I could hear colors and see sounds. "Burning Down the House" echoed from somewhere beyond the mirror. Without a word, guided by a logic that only made sense in that moment, we reached out and touched the glass.


It wasn't solid. It was like dipping our hands into cool, electric water. We took a step forward and through.


The transition felt like being gently turned inside out and then right-side in again. We weren't in the bathroom anymore. We were sitting on a celestial back porch, rocking in creaky wooden chairs that overlooked a nebula of swirling stars. The wood grain in the porch boards contained entire galaxies. The air smelled like ozone and fresh laundry and something indefinably holy.


Sitting in a third rocking chair between us was a man in a simple white tunic, but he was wearing a flannel shirt over it, unbuttoned. He had a kind, bearded face and was expertly rolling a joint with papers that seemed to be made from compressed starlight.


"Hey, fellas," he said, his voice calm and familiar, like every friend you've ever had rolled into one. "Knew you'd be dropping by. You looked like you needed a break."


My brain, the disco ball of truth, supplied the answer. "Jesus?"


He chuckled, licking the rolling paper. The sound of his laughter made nearby constellations pulse brighter. "You can call me JC. Or Jess. Whatever works. You want a hit of this? It's divine."


He lit the joint with a snap of his fingers—actual flames dancing from his fingertips—and passed it to Matthew. The Other Matthew, to his credit, took it without hesitation. "We have a problem, JC," Matthew said after a long, thoughtful drag. The smoke came out in perfect geometric patterns. "A moral quandary."


"I know," Jesus said, gesturing with his chin for Matthew to pass the joint to me (also Matthew). "The cowboy thing. Appropriation versus appreciation. It's a classic. Had the same conversation with some Romans about togas once. Also, you're both named Matthew, which is hilarious. I had two apostles named James, so I get it."


I took a hit. The smoke tasted like honey and forgotten memories and the first day of summer vacation. "So... are we bad people?"


Jesus reached into his flannel pocket and pulled out a small tin. "Before we get to that—disco biscuits? They're basically communion wafers but funkier." He popped one and passed the tin. They tasted like starlight and bass drops.


"Now," he continued, the cosmos behind him starting to pulse to "Psycho Killer," "let's talk about authenticity..."


Jesus took the joint back, took a long, slow pull, and blew a perfect smoke ring that turned into a tiny, shimmering halo before transforming into a miniature Saturn, complete with rings, then fading into the starfield. "Are you trying to hurt anyone?"


"No," we said in unison.


"Are you having a good time?"


"Yes," we said, a little more sheepishly.


"Is the music good?"


"It's pretty good, yeah."


He leaned forward, a cosmic twinkle in his eye that contained supernovas. "Look, life is a costume party, boys. Everyone's trying on different hats. Some are ten-gallon, some are crowns of thorns. Hell, I once spent three years as a carpenter—talk about commitment to a character. The trick isn't to worry about which hat you're wearing, but to make sure you dance while you've got it on. The universe is a honky-tonk, not a courtroom."


He paused, taking another hit. "Besides, you think actual cowboys weren't playing dress-up half the time? You should've seen Buffalo Bill—biggest drama queen in the West. Made your entrance look subtle."


"But what about authenticity?" Jake asked, his existential crisis evident even through the divine cannabis haze.


Jesus grinned. "Authenticity is just being true to your joy, amigo. You're not claiming to be something you're not to hurt or deceive—you're playing. The universe loves play. Why do you think I put platypuses down there? Pure cosmic joke. Now, I think those ladies are waiting for you."


He stood up, and as he did, I noticed his sandals had tiny spurs on them. "Oh, and boys? That story about breaking wild mustangs? Too much. Stick to something about fixing fences. Everyone believes fence stories."


As he turned to go, the porch, the stars, and his flannel shirt all began to dissolve like sugar in cosmic rain. "Wait!" I called out. "What's the meaning of—"


"Two-step with intention!" he called back, already fading. "And hydrate!"


The smell of ozone was replaced by industrial-strength urinal cakes. We were standing back in the men's room, staring at our own, solid reflections in the mirror. The fluorescent light just flickered, normally. Boringly. Our pupils were still enormous, but now they contained tiny galaxies.


We stared at each other, having a shared, holy, and utterly insane existential resolution.


"Dude," Jake said, his voice full of reverence. "Did we just smoke a joint with Jesus?"


"We did," I confirmed. "And Jesus thinks we should dance."


"Jesus has spurs on his sandals."


"Jesus contains multitudes."


The guilt was gone, replaced by a sense of profound, cosmic permission. We slunk back out, found the Bride Tribe, and Jake cleared his throat. The honky-tonk lights seemed friendlier now, less judgmental, more celebratory.


"Ladies, I have a confession. We're not real cowboys. We're just two guys who took acid and thought this would be fun and—"


"Oh honey, we KNOW," the bride-to-be laughed, her veil shimmering with understanding. "Half the people here are accountants from downtown. You think Chad over there really ropes cattle?" She pointed to a guy in designer boots doing the Cupid Shuffle. "But you know what? Y'all are committing to the bit, and that's what Saturday night is about!"


The relief was physical. The moral weight lifted like a ten-gallon hat off a sweaty head. The Bride Tribe adopted us immediately, teaching us a line dance that allegedly spelled out "YEEHAW" in foot movements. Whether that was true or just the acid talking, we'll never know.


We danced three more songs out of pure, divinely-sanctioned joy. During "Boot Scootin' Boogie," I could swear I saw a familiar flannel shirt in the crowd, but when I blinked, it was just some guy in plaid. The universe winked. We winked back.


We Irish-goodbye'd out the back when Matthew started explaining to someone how fence posts were "metaphors for the human condition." The night air hit us like a benevolent slap. Our spurs caught on everything—trash cans, sidewalk cracks, the very fabric of space-time. 


The Uber driver, a saint in a Corolla, didn't even blink at two cosmically-realigned cowboys piling into his backseat. He just turned up the radio, which was miraculously playing "Jolene." We harmonized badly but with great enthusiasm.


Back at the apartment, we cranked up some Dolly Parton, because what else do you play after meeting the Divine in a honky-tonk bathroom? We uncorked whatever wine was closest—it turned out to be a Pinot Grigio that Jesus's mom had gifted him, which felt weirdly appropriate. Mothers always know. Especially Mary. 


But then Matt—the third Matt, the one who'd been waiting at the apartment with the DMT—suggested we weren't done traveling yet.


Boots kicked off like sacred relics and hats still perched with ironic majesty, the three Matts gathered in a triangle—symmetrical, intentional, a ritual geometry. The rug beneath us began to shimmer, humming low like an alien bassline. We passed around the DMT pipe like it was a ceremonial baton in the cosmic relay. One breath, two breaths, and the room fractured into refracted frequencies. Reality shifted, melted, and reassembled itself inside a Daft Punk album cover circa Niles Rogers era —except this version had horses.


The walls pixelated into chrome panels, pulsing with bass like the heartbeat of a disco god. The ceiling lifted into infinite gridlines, and we weren't just in a room anymore—we were floating in a glitter-soaked orbit above a planet made entirely of rhythm. Each of us became a different flavor of synthetic cowboy: Neon Rodeo Matt had turntables for spurs. Hologram Lasso Matt spun loops of laser rope across the endless void. Disco Sheriff Matt, glowing from within like a sentient jukebox, laid down the law of groove: dance or dissolve.


Suddenly, we were standing on the main stage of a zero-gravity honky-funk rodeo. Thousands of pixelated daft punks in cowboy hats made from solar panels cheered as we rode robotic bulls across synthwave valleys. An AI called Yeehawtron challenged us to a line dance battle and promptly imploded from sheer awe when we moonwalked diagonally. The DMT pulled no punches—we met cybernetic tumbleweeds quoting Nietzsche in autotune and were baptized in a rainstorm of glitter and affirmations. At one point, a rave buffalo told us the universe is just "vibes pretending to be math."


When we blinked back into the apartment, the wine was still uncorked, Dolly Parton was shimmering through the speakers like she'd always been part of the machine, and the rug under us was just a rug again—though it did wink at us. The cowboy hats sat on the coffee table like they'd witnessed God but were too chill to brag. 


Jake emerged from the bathroom holding a single LED lightbulb, whispering, "I saw the groove behind the groove."


Matt the Third was sketching fractals on a napkin with a crayon that kept changing colors.


I was still seeing glitch horses dancing across the edges of my vision.


We line danced in the living room with the commitment of men who'd been given both celestial and synthetic permission to play. The downstairs neighbor banged on the ceiling during "9 to 5," but we were beyond earthly concerns. We were cowboys. We were dancers. We were stardust in boots. We were frequencies pretending to be human.


The morning found us passed out in full cowboy regalia, boots still on, surrounded by empty bottles and what appeared to be a lasso made from iPhone chargers. Matthew's hat had migrated to the kitchen counter. My spurs had somehow ended up in the refrigerator.


"Never again," Matt groaned, his voice muffled by a throw pillow that smelled like wine and cosmic wisdom.


"Never again," I agreed, though we both knew that was a lie. 


But we kept the hats. 


They hang on our wall now, occasional reminders that the universe is indeed a honky-tonk, that authenticity is just committed joy, and that somewhere, somewhen, there's a deity in flannel who thinks we dance just fine.


Sometimes on quiet nights, if you hold one of those hats up to your ear like a seashell, you can still hear fiddle music and the faint scent of starlight joints.


Yeehaw, amen, and pass the aspirin.

🤠💊🎶 Matt & Matt Go to the Biscuits Show: A Psychedelic Odyssey in Atlantic City


They didn't mean to end up at the Borgata. Originally, Matt and Matt had just gone out to get paper towels. One pack. That's it. But somewhere between Aisle 4 and the casino elevator, they bumped into a guy named Ravi wearing moon boots and a poncho made entirely of glowsticks who said, “You like frequencies?” and handed them two mint-flavored LSD tabs and a map made of velvet.


Matt (glasses Matt) blinked. “Wait. Did this map just wink?”


“It’s time,” said Matt (cowboy hat Matt), slipping into character like it owed him money.

🌟 Set One: Becoming Sound


1. Crowd – 1:06


Nothing like standing in line for overpriced IPA and realizing your pulse is harmonizing with the casino’s LED carpet. One of the Matts asked, “Is this the show?” and the carpet whispered back, You are the show.


2. Feeling Twisted – 15:46


Oh they felt twisted alright. Somewhere around minute six, Glasses Matt mistook a disco ball for the moon and told a blackjack dealer he was “orbiting responsibly.” Cowboy Matt was weeping at how “authentic the lasers felt.” A stranger walked by and gifted them something called “a glitter patch for emotional overheating.”


3. Spraypaint – 14:25


The music started to sound like graffiti dancing. Cowboy Matt was convinced he could “see the sonic font.” Glasses Matt kept murmuring, “This track is tagging my third eye.”


4. Under Ur Spell – 21:24


This is when things turned romantic. Not with a person—romantic with the bass line. The Matts, synchronizing perfectly, both fell in love with rhythm. One declared, “This snare drum knows me better than my therapist.” They slow-danced with a mop in the back corner while mouthing “thank you” to the lighting rig.


5. Trap Door – 14:51


Cowboy Matt shouted, “I FOUND THE EXIT,” and tried to crawl behind the bass amp. It was just a coat closet, but inside was a woman named Chandra who claimed to be “a frequency priestess.” She gave them matching temporary tattoos that read “existential groove.”


6. Rock Candy – 2:50


Just the ending. But somehow the Matts thought it was dessert. Cowboy Matt kept licking the air saying, “I taste the encore.” Glasses Matt told a bartender, “That guitar tone is crystallized rebellion.”


---


🌀 Intermission: Adventures in Bathroom Space-Time


They tried to find the restroom. Instead, they wandered into a ballroom where someone was doing tai chi while beatboxing. The chandelier gave unsolicited spiritual advice. One of the Matts opened a vending machine and retrieved what appeared to be a tiny disco ball wearing sunglasses. It whispered, “Round two approaches, traveler.”


---


🔮 Set Two: Full-Pulse Ego Dissolution


1. Crowd – 1:28


A guy in a cape screamed, “I AM THE SETBREAK,” and everyone clapped.


2. Bazaar Escape – 21:52


Suddenly, it was Cairo. But made of lasers and dubstep. Cowboy Matt bought a metaphor from a man with a camel-shaped keyboard. Glasses Matt bartered his existential dread for a glowing vial labeled “Maybe Juice.”


3. Risky Business – 24:10


Peak trip. Glasses Matt thought he was Tom Cruise. Cowboy Matt thought he was Thomas Paine. They argued. A man named Randall intervened and solved their identity crisis by saying, “You’re both just danceable ideas.”


4. And The Ladies Were The Rest Of The Night – 20:40


The Bride Tribe appeared again. One woman handed them a scroll that said “You Are Enough.” Cowboy Matt proposed to the scroll. Glasses Matt built a pyramid out of complimentary pretzels.


5. No Recollection – 19:39


Exactly. Nobody remembered anything. Someone in the back yelled “Cheesesteak Enlightenment!” and the crowd collectively ascended half a foot off the ground.


6. Spraypaint – 6:25


“This again?” muttered Cowboy Matt. But this version was deeper. He swore the rhythm had aged, matured. “The beat has a mortgage now,” he whispered.


---


🪩 Encore: The Ecstatic Finish


We Like To Party – 7:58


They did. Everyone did. The audience became a single organism named VibeSloth. Cowboy Matt crowd-surfed on someone’s inflatable surfboard made of QR codes. Glasses Matt was handed a baby goat wearing headphones. Nobody questioned it.


---


🚪 DMT Epilogue: The Cosmic Hang with Bear & Jerry


Back in the suite, they kicked off their boots and dropped into a final triangle ceremony: Matt, Matt, and a holographic goat named Julian.


Three hits of DMT later, the room liquefied into a celestial jam barn. In walked Bear, holding a cube of music so dense it had gravitational pull. Jerry Garcia sat beside him eating peach cobbler with a guitar pick.


“So,” Jerry said, looking around, “you guys do Biscuits. We did Dead. You know what the link is?”


Cowboy Matt replied without hesitation: “Radical groove-based compassion loops.”


Bear high-fived them with a quantum waveform. “You boys ever need sonic validation, call the 'Funk Frequency Union'—we're hiring.”


They became a foursome. Best friends across dimensions. Matt² + Jerry + Bear = The Grateful Biscuits.


The morning was soft and neon. The goat winked. The hats remained. And the soundtrack of July 5th pulsed softly in their veins.


-_-_-_


# 🌵🎸 Matt & Matt's Time-Traveling Mescaline Orchestra Adventure


## Act Two: Unknown Mortal Orchestra at the Fillmore


The mescaline came in buttons that looked like tiny vinyl records. Matt (now wearing both a cowboy hat AND the disco ball from the vending machine as a necklace) held one up to the light. "Is this... is this playing music?"


Matt (glasses fogged with cosmic understanding) squinted. "That's 'Hunnybee' in molecular form."


They were outside the Fillmore, having teleported there via a rideshare driver named Temporal Tony who claimed his Prius could "fold spacetime for five stars."


---


### 🕰️ The Lobby: Temporal Convergence


The moment they walked in, time started hiccupping. The merch table was staffed by versions of themselves from 1967, 2003, and 2045 simultaneously. Future Matt had chrome teeth and kept saying "You're about to understand everything."


Past Matt (wearing bell-bottoms made of pure energy) handed them t-shirts that changed designs based on what year you were thinking about.


"When does the show start?" asked Cowboy-Disco Matt.


"It already did. It's starting now. It never stopped," replied all three temporal merch Matts in unison.


---


### 🌀 The Main Floor: Chronological Chaos


**Multi-Love** began, but each instrument was playing from a different decade. The drums were broadcast live from 1971. The bass line wouldn't arrive until 2028. Ruban's guitar existed in all times simultaneously.


Glasses Matt turned to a woman next to him who was clearly from the Renaissance (the ruff collar gave it away). "Is this normal?"


She replied in perfect Elizabethan English: "Thy query assumes normalcy hath ever existed, good Matthew."


Cowboy-Disco Matt was having a full conversation with a holographic Jerry Garcia who kept materializing in the crowd. "The thing about time," Jerry explained while his face shifted through different ages, "is that it's just rhythm spread really wide."


---


### 🎭 Mid-Show Crisis: The Vibe Consultants Appear


During **Can't Keep Checking My Phone**, two figures in iridescent business suits approached. They had badges reading "Vibe Consultants, LLC" and faces that looked suspiciously familiar.


"Oh fuck," whispered Glasses Matt. "That's us from the future."


Future Cowboy Matt's hat was now made of crystallized sound waves. Future Glasses Matt's spectacles showed probability streams. They handed their past selves business cards that felt like solidified funk.


"Quick tip," Future Cowboy Matt said, "In about three songs, you're going to think you invented dancing. You didn't. But lean into it anyway."


"Also," added Future Glasses Matt, "when Ruban plays 'Swim and Sleep,' the floor will briefly become actual water. Just float."


---


### 💫 The Acoustic Ocean


They were right. During **Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)**, the Fillmore transformed into a phosphorescent sea. The audience treaded water while Ruban played from a stage that had become a coral reef. A school of neon fish swam through, each one carrying a different memory from the crowd.


Cowboy-Disco Matt caught a fish that contained his first kiss. It tasted like strawberry chapstick and sounded like The Velvet Underground.


Glasses Matt was doing the backstroke next to a time-traveling pilgrim who kept asking if this was "the promised land." Matt assured him it was.


---


### 🚪 The Hotel Room: DMT Denominational Summit


After the show, Ruban invited them back to his hotel. "You guys have the best energy I've ever seen," he said, his third eye literally visible and winking.


The hotel room was standard except for the part where it existed in seventeen dimensions. They formed their sacred geometry: Matt, Matt, and Ruban in a triangle, passing the DMT pipe like a cosmic talking stick.


Three hits in, the walls became suggestions. The ceiling opened like a jewelry box full of galaxies.


That's when Bear and Jerry materialized, sitting on a couch made of crystallized laughter.


"Ruban!" Jerry exclaimed, setting down his astral guitar. "We've been watching these cats. They're the real deal."


Bear nodded, his aura humming at 432 Hz. "Matt and Matt here are heading to see Goose next week. Interdimensional tour. You should join them."


Ruban's eyes went wide. The room reorganized itself so that suddenly Matt and Matt were on the elevated platform while Ruban looked up at them with the expression of a fan meeting their heroes.


"Wait," Ruban said, his voice trembling with cosmic reverence. "You're THE Matt and Matt? The ones who achieved Radical Groove-Based Compassion Loop certification? Who invented the Diagonal Moonwalk of Spiritual Sovereignty?"


Cowboy-Disco Matt and Glasses Matt exchanged glances. They had no memory of inventing anything, but Future Them must have done something significant.


Jerry leaned forward, his beard now made of pure wisdom. "Boys, you don't remember because it hasn't happened yet. But in about three timeline iterations, you two become the patron saints of psychedelic fellowship. Ruban here has been studying your future teachings."


Bear pulled out a book that wouldn't be written for another decade: "The Tao of Matt²: A Guide to Synchronized Cosmic Fumbling" by Matthew & Matthew.


Ruban was practically vibrating. "Can I... can I really come to the Goose show with you? I've been trying to master your Pretzel Logic Breathing Technique. And I have SO many questions about your theory of Recreational Enlightenment!"


The room pulsed with agreement. The universe nodded. Even the minibar hummed approval.


"Of course, man," said Glasses Matt, still processing that they were apparently future gurus. "But fair warning - we're planning to take ibogaine and convince ourselves we're migratory birds."


"That's EXACTLY what I was hoping for!" Ruban exclaimed, pulling out a notebook labeled "Field Notes for Following the Matts."


Jerry strummed a chord that existed in all keys simultaneously. "And so the fellowship grows. The Grateful Biscuits welcome their newest member: The Unknown Orchestra of Radical Gratitude."


Bear produced a certificate from thin air. "It's official. You're all cleared for multi-dimensional touring. Next stop: Goose in Denver. Then Phish in the Quantum Realm. After that... well, have you boys ever been to a show that hasn't happened yet?"


The DMT slowly released its hold, but the hotel room remained subtly improved. Colors were more honest. Gravity was optional. And Ruban was already packing his bags, muttering excitedly about "learning from the masters."


Cowboy-Disco Matt looked at his reflection in the window. His future self gave him a thumbs up from the other side of the glass.


"I think," he said slowly, "we're becoming the thing we were pretending to be."


Glasses Matt nodded, adjusting his frames that now showed parallel timelines. "Fake it till you make it till you fake making it till it makes you."


Ruban applauded. "See? THAT'S the kind of wisdom I need to learn! When do we leave?"


And somewhere in the cosmic distance, a goose honked in approval.

🎷🍳” Be warned: once you enter a White Denim set, time unravels into syncopated breakfast metaphors and guitar solos that smell like mango incense…” - Dicey Dovey


-_-_-_


🎸 Matt & Matt Pick Up Dicey Dovey at the White Denim Wormhole


They were somewhere between mescaline afterglow and Goosian anticipation when the GPS on Glasses Matt’s phone whispered, “Turn left into the groove.” They obeyed.


Outside a venue that looked like the architectural offspring of a jazz club and a waffle iron, White Denim was already deconstructing tempo itself. Inside, Dicey Dovey—wearing a poncho woven from mixtapes and the mood of Austin, TX—was dancing in eleven-four time while chewing on a grilled cheese made of existential cheese.


“DOVES!” Cowboy-Disco Matt bellowed, entering like a man escaping four dimensions of line dancing. “We’ve got a goose appointment in two timelines, but you’re coming!”


Dicey Dovey nodded solemnly, finishing his grilled cheese and dropping the crust into a bucket labeled "For Funk Reclamation."


The band launched into “At Night In Dreams.” Immediately, everyone’s socks evaporated from sheer rhythmic heat. A saxophone emitted low-frequency affirmations. Glasses Matt’s pupils dilated to the size of LPs. “This music feels like scrambled eggs made of intention,” he muttered.


Then “Pretty Green” hit. Cowboy-Disco Matt’s hat levitated. Dicey Dovey sprouted neon wings for no reason and started hovering slightly. A man nearby yelled, “I just forgave my stepdad!” The healing was palpable.


During “No Real Leaders,” the ceiling screamed with joy. The bass player turned into a theory. Dicey Dovey high-fived him anyway. 


---


✨ The Departure Ritual


As the encore melted into something unnamed but deeply funky, the three of them performed the ancient exit rite: each donated a shoelace to the sacred shoebox at the door marked “Time Travelers Only.”


Dicey Dovey grabbed his temporal passport—an old Etch A Sketch with coordinates scribbled across its static—and said, “Alright boys. I’m charged. Let's go see if birds can jam.”


The room winked. The bass waved goodbye. The Matts and Dovey stepped out into a shimmering Uber shaped like a goose.


TO BE CONTINUED?
