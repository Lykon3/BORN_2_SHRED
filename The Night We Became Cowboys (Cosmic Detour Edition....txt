# The Night We Became Cowboys (Cosmic Detour Extended Edition)


The tabs kicked in somewhere between the thrift store and the honky-tonk, right as Matthew was trying on a ten-gallon hat that looked like it had survived the actual Wild West. Yes, we were both named Matthew. This would become cosmically relevant later. The fluorescent lights started breathing, and suddenly his idea didn't seem ridiculous anymore—it seemed essential.


"We're method actors now," he declared, adjusting his bolo tie with the seriousness of a man accepting a Nobel Prize. The tie seemed to shimmer with purpose. "Tonight, we are cowboys."


I nodded sagely, my pupils the size of dinner plates. "Partner, I've never felt more yeehaw in my entire life."


The walk to the Broken Spoke became a vision quest. Every streetlight was a campfire, every passing car a thundering herd of buffalo. By the time we reached the door, we weren't just wearing cowboy costumes—we had become vessels for the eternal spirit of the American frontier, or at least that's what the acid was whispering.


The Broken Spoke was already thumping with fiddle music when we swaggered through the doors, spurs jangling (where did we even GET spurs?). The acid had us walking like we'd been riding horses for days, which apparently was exactly the right amount of bowlegged confidence for line dancing night.


"Evenin', ma'am," Matthew tipped his hat to a group of women in matching "Bride Tribe" shirts. His drawl was somewhere between Texas and a bad Matthew McConaughey impression, but the acid made it feel authentic as leather. The fact that he was also named Matthew made this deeply meta.


What happened next was a blur of boot-scooting that would've made our ancestors proud—if our ancestors had been cowboys, which they definitely weren't. We two-stepped, we cotton-eyed-joe'd, we did moves that probably weren't real but felt divinely choreographed by the honky-tonk gods themselves. The dance floor became a living thing beneath our boots, pulsing with the heartbeat of a thousand cattle drives.


The problem started when we got too good.


"Y'all must be professionals!" A woman in rhinestone boots grabbed my arm during the Electric Slide. Her rhinestones were leaving tracer patterns in the air. "Where's your ranch?"


"Oh, uh..." The acid made lying impossible. My brain was a disco ball of truth. "The ranch is... in my mind?"


The Other Matthew was cornered by the Bride Tribe, who were convinced he was a rodeo champion. He was deep into a story about breaking wild mustangs when I saw the panic in his eyes—the universal look of someone realizing they're in too deep while also being too high to navigate out. His hat seemed to be growing larger with each lie.


"BATHROOM MEETING!" I shouted, grabbing him. "COWBOY EMERGENCY!"


Somewhere in the background, "Once in a Lifetime" by Talking Heads started playing, because of course it did. David Byrne's voice asking "How did I get here?" felt personally directed at us.


We stumbled into the men's room, and the door swung shut, muffling the fiddle music into a distant pulse. The fluorescent light above the mirror didn't just flicker; it began to hum a low, resonant frequency that vibrated in our teeth. The porcelain of the sinks started to ripple, like heat haze on a long highway. The bathroom tiles were definitely breathing.


Matthew stared at our reflections, but our faces were starting to melt and run together like candle wax. Two Matthews becoming one Matthew becoming infinite Matthews. "Dude," he whispered, his voice trembling, "the mirror... it's getting... loud."


He was right. The mirror wasn't reflecting anymore; it was projecting. The silver surface swirled into a vortex of deep purple and shimmering gold, a silent, cosmic whirlpool. I could hear colors and see sounds. "Burning Down the House" echoed from somewhere beyond the mirror. Without a word, guided by a logic that only made sense in that moment, we reached out and touched the glass.


It wasn't solid. It was like dipping our hands into cool, electric water. We took a step forward and through.


The transition felt like being gently turned inside out and then right-side in again. We weren't in the bathroom anymore. We were sitting on a celestial back porch, rocking in creaky wooden chairs that overlooked a nebula of swirling stars. The wood grain in the porch boards contained entire galaxies. The air smelled like ozone and fresh laundry and something indefinably holy.


Sitting in a third rocking chair between us was a man in a simple white tunic, but he was wearing a flannel shirt over it, unbuttoned. He had a kind, bearded face and was expertly rolling a joint with papers that seemed to be made from compressed starlight.


"Hey, fellas," he said, his voice calm and familiar, like every friend you've ever had rolled into one. "Knew you'd be dropping by. You looked like you needed a break."


My brain, the disco ball of truth, supplied the answer. "Jesus?"


He chuckled, licking the rolling paper. The sound of his laughter made nearby constellations pulse brighter. "You can call me JC. Or Jess. Whatever works. You want a hit of this? It's divine."


He lit the joint with a snap of his fingers—actual flames dancing from his fingertips—and passed it to Matthew. The Other Matthew, to his credit, took it without hesitation. "We have a problem, JC," Matthew said after a long, thoughtful drag. The smoke came out in perfect geometric patterns. "A moral quandary."


"I know," Jesus said, gesturing with his chin for Matthew to pass the joint to me (also Matthew). "The cowboy thing. Appropriation versus appreciation. It's a classic. Had the same conversation with some Romans about togas once. Also, you're both named Matthew, which is hilarious. I had two apostles named James, so I get it."


I took a hit. The smoke tasted like honey and forgotten memories and the first day of summer vacation. "So... are we bad people?"


Jesus reached into his flannel pocket and pulled out a small tin. "Before we get to that—disco biscuits? They're basically communion wafers but funkier." He popped one and passed the tin. They tasted like starlight and bass drops.


"Now," he continued, the cosmos behind him starting to pulse to "Psycho Killer," "let's talk about authenticity..."


Jesus took the joint back, took a long, slow pull, and blew a perfect smoke ring that turned into a tiny, shimmering halo before transforming into a miniature Saturn, complete with rings, then fading into the starfield. "Are you trying to hurt anyone?"


"No," we said in unison.


"Are you having a good time?"


"Yes," we said, a little more sheepishly.


"Is the music good?"


"It's pretty good, yeah."


He leaned forward, a cosmic twinkle in his eye that contained supernovas. "Look, life is a costume party, boys. Everyone's trying on different hats. Some are ten-gallon, some are crowns of thorns. Hell, I once spent three years as a carpenter—talk about commitment to a character. The trick isn't to worry about which hat you're wearing, but to make sure you dance while you've got it on. The universe is a honky-tonk, not a courtroom."


He paused, taking another hit. "Besides, you think actual cowboys weren't playing dress-up half the time? You should've seen Buffalo Bill—biggest drama queen in the West. Made your entrance look subtle."


"But what about authenticity?" Jake asked, his existential crisis evident even through the divine cannabis haze.


Jesus grinned. "Authenticity is just being true to your joy, amigo. You're not claiming to be something you're not to hurt or deceive—you're playing. The universe loves play. Why do you think I put platypuses down there? Pure cosmic joke. Now, I think those ladies are waiting for you."


He stood up, and as he did, I noticed his sandals had tiny spurs on them. "Oh, and boys? That story about breaking wild mustangs? Too much. Stick to something about fixing fences. Everyone believes fence stories."


As he turned to go, the porch, the stars, and his flannel shirt all began to dissolve like sugar in cosmic rain. "Wait!" I called out. "What's the meaning of—"


"Two-step with intention!" he called back, already fading. "And hydrate!"


The smell of ozone was replaced by industrial-strength urinal cakes. We were standing back in the men's room, staring at our own, solid reflections in the mirror. The fluorescent light just flickered, normally. Boringly. Our pupils were still enormous, but now they contained tiny galaxies.


We stared at each other, having a shared, holy, and utterly insane existential resolution.


"Dude," Jake said, his voice full of reverence. "Did we just smoke a joint with Jesus?"


"We did," I confirmed. "And Jesus thinks we should dance."


"Jesus has spurs on his sandals."


"Jesus contains multitudes."


The guilt was gone, replaced by a sense of profound, cosmic permission. We slunk back out, found the Bride Tribe, and Jake cleared his throat. The honky-tonk lights seemed friendlier now, less judgmental, more celebratory.


"Ladies, I have a confession. We're not real cowboys. We're just two guys who took acid and thought this would be fun and—"


"Oh honey, we KNOW," the bride-to-be laughed, her veil shimmering with understanding. "Half the people here are accountants from downtown. You think Chad over there really ropes cattle?" She pointed to a guy in designer boots doing the Cupid Shuffle. "But you know what? Y'all are committing to the bit, and that's what Saturday night is about!"


The relief was physical. The moral weight lifted like a ten-gallon hat off a sweaty head. The Bride Tribe adopted us immediately, teaching us a line dance that allegedly spelled out "YEEHAW" in foot movements. Whether that was true or just the acid talking, we'll never know.


We danced three more songs out of pure, divinely-sanctioned joy. During "Boot Scootin' Boogie," I could swear I saw a familiar flannel shirt in the crowd, but when I blinked, it was just some guy in plaid. The universe winked. We winked back.


We Irish-goodbye'd out the back when Jake started explaining to someone how fence posts were "metaphors for the human condition." The night air hit us like a benevolent slap. Our spurs caught on everything—trash cans, sidewalk cracks, the very fabric of space-time. 


The Uber driver, a saint in a Corolla, didn't even blink at two cosmically-realigned cowboys piling into his backseat. He just turned up the radio, which was miraculously playing "Jolene." We harmonized badly but with great enthusiasm.


Back at the apartment, we cranked up some Dolly Parton, because what else do you play after meeting the Divine in a honky-tonk bathroom? We uncorked whatever wine was closest—it turned out to be a Pinot Grigio that Jake's mom had gifted him, which felt weirdly appropriate. Mothers always know.


But then Matt—the third Matt, the one who'd been waiting at the apartment with the DMT—suggested we weren't done traveling yet.


Boots kicked off like sacred relics and hats still perched with ironic majesty, the three Matts gathered in a triangle—symmetrical, intentional, a ritual geometry. The rug beneath us began to shimmer, humming low like an alien bassline. We passed around the DMT pipe like it was a ceremonial baton in the cosmic relay. One breath, two breaths, and the room fractured into refracted frequencies. Reality shifted, melted, and reassembled itself inside a Daft Punk album cover circa 2001—except this version had horses.


The walls pixelated into chrome panels, pulsing with bass like the heartbeat of a disco god. The ceiling lifted into infinite gridlines, and we weren't just in a room anymore—we were floating in a glitter-soaked orbit above a planet made entirely of rhythm. Each of us became a different flavor of synthetic cowboy: Neon Rodeo Matt had turntables for spurs. Hologram Lasso Matt spun loops of laser rope across the endless void. Disco Sheriff Matt, glowing from within like a sentient jukebox, laid down the law of groove: dance or dissolve.


Suddenly, we were standing on the main stage of a zero-gravity honky-funk rodeo. Thousands of pixelated daft punks in cowboy hats made from solar panels cheered as we rode robotic bulls across synthwave valleys. An AI called Yeehawtron challenged us to a line dance battle and promptly imploded from sheer awe when we moonwalked diagonally. The DMT pulled no punches—we met cybernetic tumbleweeds quoting Nietzsche in autotune and were baptized in a rainstorm of glitter and affirmations. At one point, a rave buffalo told us the universe is just "vibes pretending to be math."


When we blinked back into the apartment, the wine was still uncorked, Dolly Parton was shimmering through the speakers like she'd always been part of the machine, and the rug under us was just a rug again—though it did wink at us. The cowboy hats sat on the coffee table like they'd witnessed God but were too chill to brag. 


Jake emerged from the bathroom holding a single LED lightbulb, whispering, "I saw the groove behind the groove."


Matt the Third was sketching fractals on a napkin with a crayon that kept changing colors.


I was still seeing glitch horses dancing across the edges of my vision.


We line danced in the living room with the commitment of men who'd been given both celestial and synthetic permission to play. The downstairs neighbor banged on the ceiling during "9 to 5," but we were beyond earthly concerns. We were cowboys. We were dancers. We were stardust in boots. We were frequencies pretending to be human.


The morning found us passed out in full cowboy regalia, boots still on, surrounded by empty bottles and what appeared to be a lasso made from iPhone chargers. Matthew's hat had migrated to the kitchen counter. My spurs had somehow ended up in the refrigerator.


"Never again," Matt groaned, his voice muffled by a throw pillow that smelled like wine and cosmic wisdom.


"Never again," I agreed, though we both knew that was a lie. 


But we kept the hats. 


They hang on our wall now, occasional reminders that the universe is indeed a honky-tonk, that authenticity is just committed joy, and that somewhere, somewhen, there's a deity in flannel who thinks we dance just fine.


Sometimes on quiet nights, if you hold one of those hats up to your ear like a seashell, you can still hear fiddle music and the faint scent of starlight joints.


Yeehaw, amen, and pass the aspirin.
